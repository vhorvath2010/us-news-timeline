# Codex Session Notes

## Context
- Project: US Political News timeline demo using static HTML/CSS/JS.
- Files created: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js` with mock data and interactive timeline.
- Sandbox currently read-only; future edits require relaunch with `--sandbox-mode workspace-write` (or other writable mode).

## Recent Work (Sep 20, 2025)
- Adjusted timeline order so dates now flow left-to-right from oldest to newest.
- Latest entry auto-selects on load to keep the detail panel focused on current news.

## Next Steps
1. Review the adjusted timeline flow and confirm UX meets expectations.
2. Gather feedback on additional styling/interaction tweaks before live data hookup.
3. Plan for real data integration (manual entry vs. API/CMS) once design is finalized.

## Outstanding Questions
- Any specific visual changes or timeline behaviors to adjust before real data hookup?
- Preferred approach for sourcing and updating news data (manual entry, API, CMS)?
